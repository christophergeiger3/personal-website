<h1>About this project:</h1>
<p>
    For Computational Geometry Fall 2020 @ UConn I led a team consisting of Andrew Burns, Renzo Corihuaman, Alex Carcino, and Kieran Clarke.
    <br>
    This final product consists of a backend written in python (called with Amazon Lambda API), and a frontend written in P5.js.
    <br>
    The python backend creates random non-self-intersecting shapes and three-colors their vertices (for guard assignment).
    <br>
    The P5.js frontend renders these shapes and provides various tools for examining them.

    The Art Gallery Problem takes a polygon with obstacles inside of it, and returns the minimum number of "Guards"
    needed to view every point inside that polygon. <br>A guard can see 360 degrees around himself, but not through any of
    the walls of the polygon or obstacles. This problem has been proven to be NP-hard, so the team aimed only to
    implement an algorithm that returns a correct answer (i.e. a non-efficient solution). 
    <br><br>
    The first step in our project was finding a way to randomly generate polygons that we could treat as our art gallery.
    This could include adding some interior polygons as obstacles.<br> This is not a simple task and will took up a decent
    chunk of time for this project. This is because these polygons had not only interior walls, but also
    non-overlapping walls or disconnected sections which as opposed to the random shapes the team had generated in the
    past.
    <br><br>
    Once we had the ability to create galleries as inputs for our problem we moved on to returning a solution. This
    was the main chunk of our project; researching different ways this problem has been solved before and the
    tradeoffs different algorithms provide. We then had to implement some algorithm to work with the code we wrote
    for creating the galleries.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, we aimed to add a graphical representation of the art gallery problem as a web application. To do this,
    the team learned the basics of p5.js, a modern web graphics library, and used it to model solutions of the
    art gallery problem for simple shapes with a small number of guards. Our final deliverable consists of this
    application hosted over the web.
